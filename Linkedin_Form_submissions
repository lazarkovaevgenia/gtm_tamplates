GTM Tag Setup Case: Linkedin Form submissions

Goal: Track form submissions for lead generation on specific  page  
Tag Type: Custom HTML Tag (LinkedIn conversion tracking)  
Trigger: Custom Event `form_submit` on `/page-path` page    # DataLayer
Custom Variable: JavaScript variable checking if the form was already submitted (via localStorage)


Implementation Steps:

1. Created a Custom JavaScript variable named `Is First Form Submit`:  
   
   function() {
     return localStorage.getItem('form_submitted') !== 'true';
   }

2. Built a trigger of type Custom Event with:
Event name: form_submit

Conditions:
Page Path contains /page-path
Is First Form Submit equals true

3. Configured a Custom HTML Tag to fire on that trigger:

<script>
  window.lintrk('track', { conversion_id: ######## });   # add Linkedin conversion ID
  localStorage.setItem('form_submitted', 'true');
</script>

4. Tested the setup using GTM Preview Mode.
